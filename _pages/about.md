I am Chenxi Liu (ÂàòÊô®Êõ¶), and you may also call me Dylan. I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the [University of Utah](https://www.civil.utah.edu/). I earned my Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from [Tsinghua University](https://www.civil.tsinghua.edu.cn/ceen/) in 2017, and completed my MS and Ph.D. degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering at the [University of Washington](https://www.ce.washington.edu/) in 2020 and 2024, respecitively.

My research focused on the situation-aware customized machine intelligence to establish a connected and autonomous transportation system for safety, equity, and resiliency. More specifically, I prefer to develop **advanced traffic sensing technologies** (traffic environment sensing, 3D object sensing, crowds sensing, cooperative sensing) with **distributed machine intelligence** (edge computing) to build a **connected and smart transportation system** for various applications (SPaT challenge, intersection safety, dilemma zone mitigation).

I am pleased to offer fully funded Ph.D. positions starting from Autumn 2026 in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at University of Utah](https://www.civil.utah.edu). Candidates will engage in cutting-edge research focused on **customizing machine intelligence within the field of intelligent transportation**. Key areas of research will include, but are not limited to:

* Integrated sensing technologies
* Cyber-physical cooperation
* Distributed computing
* Predictive control methods
* Generative Artificial Intelligence
* 

If you are passionate about these research areas and enjoy living in [Salt Lake City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City), which offers [world-class skiing](https://www.visitutah.com/plan-your-trip/plan-your-ski-trip/utahs-easy-access) and [numerous amazing national parks](https://www.nps.gov/state/ut/index.htm), I would be delighted to consider you for our team at [University of Utah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Utah). Dedicated research experience or background is NOT required. We are looking for candidates who are driven by passions for the field and a commitment to long-term goals. Together, we can develop our research expertise.

Please send your transcript and CV to me at [chenxi.liu@utah.edu](). Let‚Äôs join forces and make a significant impact while having fun along the way!üòÑ

Undergraduate/graduate visitors are also welcome.
